# Migration Summary: From Compilation to Download-Based Architecture

This document summarizes the changes made to migrate gollama.cpp from a compilation-based architecture to a download-based architecture using pre-built binaries from the official llama.cpp releases.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. New Files Created

- **`downloader.go`**: Core download functionality for fetching pre-built binaries from GitHub releases
- **`cmd/gollama-download/main.go`**: Command-line tool for manual library management
- **Updated documentation**: README.md and PLATFORM_MIGRATION.md

### 2. Modified Files

- **`loader.go`**: Updated to use downloader instead of embedded libraries
- **`Makefile`**: Removed compilation targets, added download targets, kept `clone-llamacpp` for development
- **`go.mod`**: Remains minimal (only purego dependency)

### 3. Removed Complexity

- **Compilation targets**: All `build-llamacpp-*` targets removed (compilation no longer needed)
- **GPU detection**: No longer needed at build time
- **CMake dependencies**: Eliminated for regular builds
- **Cross-compilation complexity**: Simplified

### 4. Retained Development Tools

- **`clone-llamacpp` target**: Kept for developers who need access to llama.cpp source code and documentation for cross-reference purposes

## Architecture Overview

### Download System

The new system automatically downloads appropriate binaries from [ggml-org/llama.cpp releases](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases):

```
Release Pattern Examples:
- macOS: llama-b6089-bin-macos-arm64.zip
- Linux: llama-b6089-bin-ubuntu-x64.zip  
- Windows: llama-b6089-bin-win-cpu-x64.zip
```

### Platform Detection

```go
func (d *LibraryDownloader) GetPlatformAssetPattern() (string, error) {
    switch runtime.GOOS {
    case "darwin":
        return fmt.Sprintf("llama-.*-bin-macos-%s.zip", arch), nil
    case "linux":
        return fmt.Sprintf("llama-.*-bin-ubuntu-%s.zip", arch), nil
    case "windows":
        return fmt.Sprintf("llama-.*-bin-win-cpu-%s.zip", arch), nil
    }
}
```

### Library Loading Flow

1. **First use**: Library downloader initializes automatically
2. **Version selection**: Latest release or specific version (e.g., "b6089")
3. **Platform detection**: Determines appropriate binary variant
4. **Download & extract**: Downloads and caches binary locally
5. **Library loading**: Uses existing platform-specific loading code

### Cache Management

- **Location**: `~/.cache/gollama/libs/` (Linux/macOS) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%/gollama/libs/` (Windows)
- **Structure**: Each version gets its own directory
- **Cleanup**: Manual via `make clean-libs` or `-clean-cache` flag

## User Impact

### Benefits

✅ **No build dependencies**: No need for CMake, compilers, or GPU SDKs  
✅ **Faster setup**: Downloads are much faster than compilation  
✅ **Always up-to-date**: Uses latest official llama.cpp releases  
✅ **Cross-platform**: Works consistently across all platforms  
✅ **GPU support**: Automatically gets GPU-enabled binaries when available  

### Breaking Changes

❌ **None**: Public API remains completely unchanged

### Migration Required

❌ **None**: Existing code works without modification

## Developer Impact

### New Makefile Targets

```bash
# Library management
make download-libs          # Download for current platform
make download-libs-all      # Download for all platforms
make test-download          # Test download functionality
make clean-libs             # Clean library cache

# Existing targets (updated)
make test                   # Now downloads libraries automatically
make build                  # Cross-compilation still works
make test-cross-compile     # Tests compilation for all platforms
```

### Manual Library Management

```bash
# Command-line tool
go run ./cmd/gollama-download -download                 # Latest version
go run ./cmd/gollama-download -download -version b6089  # Specific version
go run ./cmd/gollama-download -test-download            # Test only
go run ./cmd/gollama-download -clean-cache              # Clean cache
```

### Programmatic API

```go
// Load specific version
err := gollama.LoadLibraryWithVersion("b6089")

// Clean cache
err := gollama.CleanLibraryCache()

// Manual downloader usage
downloader, err := gollama.NewLibraryDownloader()
release, err := downloader.GetLatestRelease()
// ... etc
```

## Technical Implementation

### Download Flow

1. **GitHub API**: Fetch release information from `api.github.com`
2. **Asset matching**: Use regex to find platform-specific binary
3. **Download**: HTTP download with progress (if needed)
4. **Extract**: ZIP extraction to cache directory
5. **Locate**: Find main library file in extracted structure
6. **Load**: Use existing platform-specific loading code

### Error Handling

- Network errors: Graceful fallback with clear error messages
- Missing releases: Helpful error for invalid versions
- Platform support: Clear indication when platform not supported
- Cache corruption: Automatic re-download on validation failure

### Security Considerations

- **Official sources**: Only downloads from official ggml-org/llama.cpp releases
- **ZIP extraction**: Safe extraction with path validation
- **User agent**: Identifies as gollama.cpp for GitHub API calls
- **No embedded credentials**: Uses public GitHub API

## Testing

### Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Cross-compilation for all platforms
2. ✅ Download functionality for current platform (Linux x64)
3. ✅ Platform pattern matching for all supported platforms
4. ✅ Library extraction and loading
5. ✅ Cache management and cleanup
6. ✅ Command-line tool functionality
7. ✅ Makefile target integration

### Test Results

```bash
$ make test-cross-compile
# ✅ All platforms compile successfully

$ make test-download  
# ✅ Download functionality works

$ make download-libs
# ✅ Library downloads and loads successfully
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Renovate Integration**: Automatic dependency updates for new llama.cpp releases
2. **GPU Variant Selection**: Smart selection based on detected hardware
3. **Progress Indicators**: Download progress for large binaries

### Recently Implemented Improvements

4. ✅ **Parallel Downloads**: Concurrent downloads for multiple platforms
   - Download libraries for all platforms simultaneously
   - Configurable concurrency limits (default: 4 concurrent downloads)
   - Command-line support: `-download-all` and `-platforms "platform1,platform2"`
   - Makefile targets: `make download-libs-parallel` and `make download-libs-platforms`

5. ✅ **Checksum Verification**: SHA256 calculation and verification for downloaded binaries
   - Automatic SHA256 calculation during download
   - Verification support for provided checksums
   - Command-line checksum display: `-checksum` flag
   - Standalone checksum calculation: `-verify-checksum filename`

### Extensibility

The architecture easily supports:
- New platforms as they become available in llama.cpp releases
- Different binary variants (CUDA, HIP, etc.)
- Alternative download sources
- Custom caching strategies

## New Features: Parallel Downloads & Checksum Verification

### Parallel Downloads

The system now supports downloading libraries for multiple platforms concurrently, dramatically reducing total download time for cross-platform development.

#### Features
- **Concurrent Processing**: Up to 4 simultaneous downloads (configurable)
- **Platform-Specific Detection**: Automatically detects correct library files for each platform (.so, .dylib, .dll)
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time status updates for each platform
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with detailed error messages

#### Command-Line Usage
```bash
# Download for all supported platforms
go run ./cmd/gollama-download -download-all -checksum

# Download for specific platforms
go run ./cmd/gollama-download -platforms "linux/amd64,darwin/arm64,windows/amd64" -checksum

# Makefile targets
make download-libs-parallel        # All platforms with checksums
make download-libs-platforms       # Specific platforms
```

#### Programmatic API
```go
// Download for multiple platforms
platforms := []string{"linux/amd64", "darwin/arm64", "windows/amd64"}
results, err := gollama.DownloadLibrariesForPlatforms(platforms, "b6089")

// Process results
for _, result := range results {
    if result.Success {
        fmt.Printf("✅ %s: %s (SHA256: %s)\n", 
            result.Platform, result.LibraryPath, result.SHA256Sum)
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("❌ %s: %v\n", result.Platform, result.Error)
    }
}
```

### Checksum Verification

All downloads now include automatic SHA256 checksum calculation for integrity verification and security auditing.

#### Features
- **Automatic Calculation**: SHA256 computed during download (no additional I/O)
- **Verification Support**: Can verify against provided checksums
- **Standalone Utility**: Calculate checksums for any file
- **Security**: Detects corrupted or tampered downloads

#### Command-Line Usage
```bash
# Download with checksum display
go run ./cmd/gollama-download -download -checksum

# Verify checksum of existing file
go run ./cmd/gollama-download -verify-checksum path/to/file.zip

# Parallel downloads with checksums
go run ./cmd/gollama-download -download-all -checksum
```

#### Programmatic API
```go
// Calculate SHA256 for any file
checksum, err := gollama.GetSHA256ForFile("/path/to/file")

// Downloads automatically include checksums in results
results, err := gollama.DownloadLibrariesForPlatforms(platforms, version)
// results[i].SHA256Sum contains the calculated checksum
```

#### Example Output
```
Download Results:
================
✅ linux/amd64: SUCCESS (Library: .../libllama.so)
✅ darwin/arm64: SUCCESS (Library: .../libllama.dylib)
   SHA256: e5ec9a20b0e77ba87ed5d8938e846ab5f03c3e11faeea23c38941508f3008ff8
✅ windows/amd64: SUCCESS (Library: .../llama.dll)
   SHA256: 7e7d3de87806f0b780ecd9458da3afe0fe11bf8edb5e042aafec1d71ff9eb9e8

Summary: 3/3 platforms downloaded successfully
```
