# GritLM Example Summary

## Overview
Created a comprehensive **GritLM (Generative Representational Instruction Tuning)** example that demonstrates unified dual-purpose language model capabilities for both embedding generation and text generation using a single model.

## What is GritLM?
GritLM is a breakthrough unified model architecture that can perform:
- **Text Embedding Generation** - High-quality vector representations for semantic search
- **Text Generation** - Conversational AI and content generation
- **RAG Pipeline** - End-to-end retrieval-augmented generation with one model

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dual-Purpose Architecture
- **Embedding Mode**: Uses `<|user|>...<|embed|>` instruction format
- **Generation Mode**: Uses `<|user|>...<|assistant|>` instruction format
- Single model eliminates need for separate embedding/generation models

### 2. Semantic Search Capabilities
- Document corpus indexing with 4096-dimensional embeddings
- Query-document similarity computation using cosine similarity
- Best match identification and relevance ranking
- Vector normalization for optimal similarity computation

### 3. Text Generation Setup
- Generation prompt formatting for conversational AI
- Context preparation for RAG pipeline integration
- Demonstrates setup for full text generation workflow

### 4. Real-World Applications
- **Document Search**: Index and search large document collections
- **RAG Systems**: Retrieve relevant context and generate responses
- **Semantic Analysis**: Compare text similarity and meaning
- **Unified AI**: Single model for multiple AI tasks
