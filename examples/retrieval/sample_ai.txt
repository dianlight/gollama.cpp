Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that deals with the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that gives computers the ability to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.

Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos.

Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots.

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

Neural networks are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm finds patterns in data without being explicitly told what to look for.
