# Introduction
echo "üìö What is Speculative Decoding?"
echo ""
echo "Speculative decoding is an optimization technique that can speed up text generation"
echo "by using a smaller 'draft' model to predict tokens ahead, then verifying them"
echo "with a larger 'target' model. This can provide 2-4x speedup while maintaining"
echo "the same quality as using the target model alone."
echo ""
echo "Process:"
echo "1. Draft model generates N tokens ahead"
echo "2. Target model verifies these predictions in parallel" 
echo "3. Matching predictions are accepted; mismatches trigger new sampling"
